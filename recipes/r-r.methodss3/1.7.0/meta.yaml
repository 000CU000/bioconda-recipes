  summary: |
    Methods that simplify the setup of S3 generic functions and S3 methods.  Major
    effort has been made in making definition of methods as simple as possible with
    a minimum of maintenance for package developers.  For example, generic functions
    are created automatically, if missing, and naming conflict are automatically solved,
    if possible.  The method setMethodS3() is a good start for those who in the future
    may want to migrate to S4.  This is a cross-platform package implemented in pure
    R that generates standard S3 methods.
