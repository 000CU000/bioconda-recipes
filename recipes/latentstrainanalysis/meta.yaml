  summary: "Partitioning and analysis methods for large, complex sequence datasets"
  description: |
    LSA was developed as a pre-assembly tool for partitioning metagenomic reads.
    It uses a hyperplane hashing function and streaming SVD in order to find
    covariance relations between k-mers. The code, and the process outline in
    LSFScripts in particular, have been optimized to scale to massive data
    sets in fixed memory with a highly distributed computing environment.
