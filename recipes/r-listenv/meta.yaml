  summary: List environments are environments that have list-like properties.  For instance,
    the elements of a list environment are ordered and can be accessed and iterated
    over using index subsetting, e.g. 'x <- listenv(a=1, b=2); for (i in seq_along(x))
    x[[i]] <- x[[i]]^2; y <- as.list(x)'.
