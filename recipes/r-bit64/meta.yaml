  summary: |
    Package ''bit64'' provides serializable S3 atomic 64bit (signed) integers  that
    can be used in vectors, matrices, arrays and data.frames. Methods are  available
    for coercion from and to logicals, integers, doubles, characters  and factors as
    well as many elementwise and summary functions. Many fast  algorithmic operations
    such as ''match'' and ''order'' support interactive data exploration and manipulation
    and optionally leverage caching.
