    summary: The package provides efficient low-level and highly reusable S4 classes for storing ranges of integers, RLE vectors (Run-Length Encoding), and, more generally, data that can be organized sequentially (formally defined as Vector objects), as well as views on these Vector objects. Efficient list-like classes are also provided for storing big collections of instances of the basic classes. All classes in the package use consistent naming and share the same rich and consistent Vector API as much as possible.
