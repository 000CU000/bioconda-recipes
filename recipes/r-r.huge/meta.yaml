  summary: 'DEPRECATED. Do not start building new projects based on this package. Cross-platform
    alternatives are the following packages: bigmemory (CRAN), ff (CRAN), BufferedMatrix
    (Bioconductor).  The main usage of it was inside the aroma.affymetrix package. (The
    package currently provides a class representing a matrix where the actual data is
    stored in a binary format on the local file system.  This way the size limit of
    the data is set by the file system and not the memory.)'
