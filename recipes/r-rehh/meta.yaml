  summary: Functions for the detection of footprints of selection on dense SNP data using Extended
    Homozygosity Haplotype (EHH) based tests. The package includes computation of EHH,
    iHS (within population) and Rsb (across pairs of populations) statistics. Various
    plotting functions are also included to facilitate visualization and interpretation
    of the results.
