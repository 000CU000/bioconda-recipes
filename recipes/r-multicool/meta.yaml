  summary: !!python/unicode 'A set of tools to permute multisets without loops or hash tables
    and to generate integer partitions. The permutation functions are based on C code
    from Aaron Williams. Cool-lex order is similar to colexicographical order. The algorithm
    is described in Williams, A. Loopless Generation of Multiset Permutations by Prefix
    Shifts. SODA 2009, Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, New York, United States. The
    permutation code is distributed without restrictions. The code for stable and efficient
    computation of multinomial coefficients comes from Dave Barber. The code can be
    download from http://home.comcast.net/~tamivox/dave/multinomial/index.html and is
    distributed without conditions. The package also generates the integer partitions
    of a positive, non-zero integer n. The C++ code for this is based on Python code
    from Jerome Kelleher which can be found here http://jeromekelleher.net/partitions.php.
    The C++ code and Python code are distributed without conditions.'
