# PHYLIP, the Phylogeny Inference Package, is a package of programs
# for inferring phylogenies (evolutionary trees). It has been
# distributed since 1980, and has over 30,000 registered users, making
# it the most widely distributed package of phylogeny programs. It is
# available free, from its web site:
#
# http://evolution.gs.washington.edu/phylip.html
#
# PHYLIP is available as source code in C, and also as executables for
# some common computer systems. It can infer phylogenies by parsimony,
# compatibility, distance matrix methods, and likelihood. It can also
# compute consensus trees, compute distances between trees, draw
# trees, resample data sets by bootstrapping or jackknifing, edit
# trees, and compute distance matrices. It can handle data that are
# nucleotide sequences, protein sequences, gene frequencies,
# restriction sites, restriction fragments, distances, discrete
# characters, and continuous characters.
